## Overview
This project began on the 7th of June 2023 as a C group project extension for the first year undergraduate Computing course at Imperial College London.  
We managed to create a simple yet entertaining dungeon crawler within roughly two weeks. We enjoyed the atmosphere in our team so much that we decided to continue the project at least throughout the summer.  
It is now a place where we mostly have fun exploring new algorithms and see how they affect our game. However, we also intend to keep our codebase professional and gain experience on how to work efficiently in a team.
